This approach circumvents the GIL, allowing true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks by leveraging multiple CPUs or cores. Each process has its own instance of the Python interpreter and memory space, which means they don't share global variables. Communication between processes is possible but more complex and involves using inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms.\n"

    "The implementation of threading in the Site Connectivity Checker project brings to light several key advantages, particularly for I/O-bound tasks such as checking the availability of websites. These benefits include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concurrent Execution**: Threading allows multiple website checks to occur simultaneously, significantly reducing the total execution time compared to a sequential approach.\n",
    "- **Improved Responsiveness**: For applications that require maintaining responsiveness while performing background tasks (such as a GUI application), threading can perform long-running checks without freezing the user interface.\n",

    "- **Race Conditions**: When two or more threads access shared data and try to change it at the same time, it can lead to inconsistent or unexpected outcomes.\n",
    "- **Thread Safety**: Not all code is thread-safe, meaning it can produce errors or unexpected results when accessed by multiple threads concurrently. Special care must be taken when accessing shared resources or mutable data structures.\n",
    "- **Deadlocks**: This occurs when two or more threads are waiting on each other to release resources, causing all of them to remain blocked indefinitely.\n",
