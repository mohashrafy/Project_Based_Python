# Site Connectivity Checker
> DIFFICULTY: **INTERMEDIATE**

A site connectivity checker is an application that helps us to monitor whether a website is available or not. There are many times when we open a url and the site isn’t available. To avoid such troubles we can use a website connectivity checker. The user just needs to input the url and it will be checked and availability will be visible. We will be making this project using **urllib** library and **tkinter** library.

## TODO

1. Create a GUI based project which will have an input field where user enter the url.
2. Your GUI needs a button for check
3. Get url from the user
4. Send an http request to the entered url and get its status code. If the code is 200, it means the site is available.
5. If the url is available “Available” will be displayed else “Not Available” will be displayed. 

## Install dependencies

``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
