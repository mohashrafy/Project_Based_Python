# YouTube Downloader

Welcome to the YouTube Downloader Project! In this project, you will develop a Python application that allows users to download YouTube videos for offline viewing. Your mission is to create a Python script that takes a YouTube video URL as input and downloads the video to the user's local system. This project will provide a hands-on experience with the `pytube` library, user input handling, and feedback mechanisms such as a download progress bar.

Users shoudl be able to run YouTube Downloader from the command line or used as a module in other Python scripts. Here are the basic steps to use the tool:

```sh
python youtube_downloader.py <youtube-url> <video-quality> <output-directory>
```

And the video(s) will be downloaded to the specified output directory.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Learn to use the `pytube` library to interact with YouTube content.
- Understand how to filter and select video streams based on parameters like resolution and file extension.
- Create a command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction.
- Implement a progress bar to show download progress.
- Practice exception handling for a robust application.
- Manage file input/output in Python.

## Features

- **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: A simple CLI for easy interaction with the downloader. This is the primary interface through which users will interact with your application.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: As an advanced feature, consider developing a GUI using a library like `streamlit` for a more user-friendly experience. This is optional but can greatly enhance usability.
- **Download Progress Bar**: Incorporate real-time feedback on the download progress so users can see how much of the video has been downloaded.
- **Configurable Settings**: Allow users to set default download folders, preferred video quality, and other settings to customize their experience.
- **Playlist Downloading**: Another advanced feature is to enable users to download entire playlists in addition to individual videos.
- **Audio Extraction**: Give users the option to download only the audio track of a video in MP3 format.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle common errors, such as invalid URLs or network issues.

## How to Use the `pytube` Library

You are encouraged to use the `pytube` library for this project, which is a Python library for interfacing with YouTube content. It allows you to query for metadata about videos, streams, and playlists; as well as download video and audio streams.

To learn more about `pytube`, you can explore the official documentation and this [repo](https://github.com/pytube/pytube/tree/master). It will guide you through the process of using `pytube` and help you implement the required features for the project.

Good luck with your project, and enjoy the process of creating your own YouTube Downloader!
